    "Network reconnaissance is a huge field involving various methods, such as port scanning, subdomain exploration, OS fingerprinting and et cetera. In this report, the focus of the algorithm is to parse HTTP logs and potentially identify IP addresses that are conducting activities associated with network reconnaissance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this dataset was obtained from a pentesting event held by [Mid-Atlantic CCDC in 2012](https://maccdc.org/2012-agenda/), the dataset contains a combination of network reconnaissance and actual attacks against the network. Due to the unlabelled(\\*) nature of the dataset, it is impossible to identify which row is logged from an reconnaissance attempt or from an actual attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining ideas from [\\[1\\]](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DST-Group-TN-1640.pdf) and [\\[2\\]](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1812/1812.01941.pdf), we attempt to combine both rule-based and ML approaches to reconnaissance detection. We include a *rule-based* approach by generating features that would double as rule-based approach to generating alerts. The features incorporates rules based on the scoring system, where known properties of widely used reconnaissance tools are given a higher (more malicious) score. When fed into the ML model, this model learns both these features and scores, eventually learning from these rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the features engineered, as explained in the *feature engineering* section, is built with network reconnaissance in mind, it is inevitable to detect network attacks as both are anomalous HTTP traffic. As such, I recognize that this algorithm would pick up not just reconnaissance but actual attacks as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following report is broken down into the separate architecture components, starting with data pre-processing, time-bining, feature engineering, running the model, data evaluation and retraining the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(\\*) Disclaimer: The source providing this set of HTTP logs does provide a snort analysis of the network logs. This includes analysis includes alerts flagged out based on the Snort rule-based alerts [\\[1\\].](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DST-Group-TN-1640.pdf) However, I experienced technical difficulties in running Snort software on my computer. It is possible to use these alerts as a base for tagging the dataset and run semi-supervised learning to obtain better results in the future."

    "## Data pre-processing\n",
    "This section is largely focused on cleaning and formatting the data as follows:\n",
    "1. Importing the necessary libraries\n",
    "2. Setting up the pandas dataframe and include missing headers(\\*)\n",
    "3. Removing poorly formatted rows\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the observations from processing the dataset provided was that the delimiter used (default for Bro logs is '\\t') was inappropriate for this dataset as certain payload included the '\\t'. we remove these rows to ensure that our data is properly formatted before moving onto feature engineering and model training. As these rows likely included malicious payloads that caused the formatting for a particular and subsequent rows to be corrupted, dropping them might cause some critical information to be lost. This can be further considered in subsequent iterations of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "From the warnings thrown by parsing the dataset, we observe that columns \"referrer\", \"user_agent\" and \"request_body_len\" contain corrupted cell values. We then search for the delimiter '\\t' that would still be present in the data (since it was not caught as a delimiter) and other possible indicators of corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Further improvements\n",
    "1. Consider labelling dropped rows as malicious \n",

    "## Model Testing\n",
    "Taking inspiration from the various papers [\\[1\\]](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DST-Group-TN-1640.pdf)[\\[2\\]](https://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/2473/network-reconnaissance-detection-prevention/104296)[\\[3\\]](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1812/1812.01941.pdf) we identified that Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and One-Class SVM as two possible unsupervised learning algorithms appropriate for our unlabelled dataset situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the algorithm, we normalized our data using a simple standard scaler. This normalizes the features into a Gaussian distribution, thus normalizing our scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Further improvements\n",
    "1. PCA or SVD, can be used to compare the importance of the different features or as features into the model. However, since we lose feature context when vectors are decomposed, this should only be considered further into the research.\n",
    "2. Further tests on other unsupervised models like Isolation Forest, or fine tuning the model parameters can also be used to get the optimal model for this use case."
